# Filters-for-EEG-waves.
Contains codes for different types of filters that can be used to filter out noise from EEG waves.

This project focuses on filtering out high freqquency component which can be interpreted as Electrooculography (EOG) wave from the Electroencephalography (EEG) waves. The given dataset was obtained from kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/eeg-alpha-wave-recording

A1.m - Low pass filter for all the channels.
B1.m - Band pass filter for all the channels.
BSF.m - Band stop filter for all the channels.
A2.m - Low pass filter for a single channel.
B2.m - Band pass filter for a single channel.
